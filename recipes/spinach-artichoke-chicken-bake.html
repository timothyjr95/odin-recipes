        <p><img src="./recipe-images/SpinachArtichokeChickenbake.jpg"></p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Just because dip is typically an appetizer doesn’t mean you can’t use it in main dishes. We already know it makes a delicious pasta sauce. Turns out, it can also make a flavorful and juicy chicken bake, too. And if you like smothered chicken and stuffed chicken breast, this 2-ingredient recipe is sure to become a regular in your cooking rotation.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pieces thinly-sliced chicken breast</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons spinach artichoke dip</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, for seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place your desired amount of chicken breast into a greased baking dish. For one or two cutlets, an 8-inch square dishes work great. For a family-sized serving, you’ll want to upgrade to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Feel free to add salt, pepper, or additional seasoning to your liking.</li>
            <li>Spread 2 tablespoons of dip (more if you like extra sauce) on top of each piece of chicken, covering as evenly as possible. Place into the oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes until the chicken’s internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). The dip should be lightly browned and bubbling when done.</li>
