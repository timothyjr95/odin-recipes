# odin-recipes
For this project I was tasked with creating a website of several recipes from allrecipes.com. Alongside the standard HTML boilerplate, this project incorporated unordered lists, ordered lists, headings, paragraphs, images, and hyperlinks. This was my first time commiting to git (github) and creating git commit messages.
